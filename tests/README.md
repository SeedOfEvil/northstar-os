# Tests

Tests are organized by evidence level:

- `unit/` for libraries and Qt components;
- `integration/` for session and service behavior;
- `vm/` for clean install, boot, package, update, and rollback checks;
- `screenshots/` for approved visual regression evidence.

Tests must state the required FreeBSD release, packages, privileges, and cleanup behavior.
